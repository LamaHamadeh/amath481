## Description

Survey of practical numerical solution techniques for ordinary and partial
differential systems. Emphasis will be on implementation of numerical schemes to
practical problems of engineering and physical sciences. Methods for partial
differential equations will include finite differences, finite elements and
spectral techniques. Full use will be made of MATLAB and its built-in
programming and solving functionality.
